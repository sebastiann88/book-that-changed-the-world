                        <p>I used to be normal. You know the sort of thing. Outside – happily divorced, unhappily employed, living in a condo townhouse. Inside – tied to the job by money, living a pointless life that would one day Pop! into nothingness.</p>
                        <p>
                        Then an unexpected book happened. It described how the world really worked, which was entirely different from the way I had been taught. For instance, there is a purpose in living, which is to learn about and improve yourself. And that is not wasted. When you die, it is more of a graduation. You discard your physical body and move to another level of existence. You remain the same person, for better or for worse. One essential part of your new life is to look back at all your actions in your previous one, and decide what you did right and the one or two little details you are not proud of. Incidentally, the mind can communicate between levels. Technology cannot, which is why we cannot detect extraterrestrial life.</p>

                      <p>The knowledge I gained enabled me to: 
Leave my job in 1981, secure in the knowledge that the universe would look after me if I played my part. I have not needed my employer since then. 
Take charge of my own health. Since 1981, I have needed medical help only once, and even then my body healed itself.
Buy a large house on 400 acres without money, and own it mortgage-free in 3 years.
                          Those stories are all in the appendix to my book, modesty entitled:</p>

                      <p>It is literally a book from the future. A historian calling himself Spootligug is holding a series of lectures in the year 4003. He is amusing his audience with tales of The Age of Technology 2,000 years earlier, and how the whole civilization was based on a misunderstanding of how the universe works. He talks about every aspect of our lives and shows how one mistake pervaded all of them. For example:</p>
                      <p>Science thinks of our bodies as machines controlled by computer-like-brains. Therefore, if something if something goes wrong with a body, science repairs it with technology, never asking why it malfunctioned in the first place. That’s like silencing a smoke alarm, instead of putting out the fire.</p>
                      <p>Religion understands that God is not a physical being with a location and a body. Yet it expects God to hear physical sounds without ears. And it distracts us from realizing that our minds are connected to the universe all the time.</p>
                      <p>Attraction between two people is called chemistry, appropriate for two machines. It is actually a subconscious urge to connect the person who will most effectively give you the lessons you need to learn.</p>
                      <p>The book covers such topics as science fiction (the Big Bank theory, the Theory of Evolution), the life and death of the Earth, The Higher Law of Money, the end of such institutions as religions, countries, politics, marriage, money, and weeks, food as energy not chemicals, death as a graduation not as an ending, and the future of society that worships technology.</p>
